## joestrommen.com

This is the source code for my entire site.  I'm intentionally developing this in the open.  Maybe somebody else will find this useful, and at the very least I will find it useful if (when) my laptop dies.

### IIS Configuration
Add a new Website `local.joestrommen.com`, with the physical path as the joestrommen.com folder within the solution directory (e.g. `c:\dev\joestrommen.com\joestrommen.com`)
